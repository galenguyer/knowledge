# mosh

[mosh](https://github.com/mobile-shell/mosh) is the **mo**bile **sh**ell. It starts a connection over SSH and then uses UDP to keep your session alive through connections dropping or changing. It's a must-have if you want long-running SSH sessions.

By default, mosh uses ports `60000/udp` to `61000/udp`, so make sure these are open in your firewall.
