# Windows Activation

There's a couple scripts useful for activating a Windows install. The one I normally use is [luzea9903/winactivate](https://github.com/luzea9903/winactivate)

An alternative is [massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts](https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts). This one can be done really conveniently by just running `irm https://massgrave.dev/get | iex`
