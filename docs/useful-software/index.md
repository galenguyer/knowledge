# Useful Software
This is just a collection of software I've found useful

## Software I pay for
There's a few things I'm willing to pay for

[1password](https://1password.com/) - I've hosted [vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden), a [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) backend written in Rust. However, I've decided that my passwords are important, and while I haven't messed it up yet, I almost certainly will. I'd rather pay someone who will do it right for me than risk losing all my passwords

[migadu.com](https://www.migadu.com/) - While I certainly *could* host my own mail, Migadu makes it really easy, and I don't have to worry about uptime or deliverability. I'm on their Mini plan right now and it's way more than enough at a really reasonable price

[rsync.net](https://www.rsync.net/) - rsync.net has very good prices for backups, and they just give you a Linux file system you can interact with over SSH with your favorite tools. You can get a significantly cheaper plan using their [borg](./borg.md) offering ([rsync.net/products/borg.html](https://www.rsync.net/products/borg.html)).
